## Starcross

STARCROSS, Infocom's science fiction mind-bender, launches you headlong into the year 2186 and the depths of space. And not without good reason, four you are destined to rendezvous with a gargantuan starship from the outer fringes of the galaxy. 

## Description

![](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/starcross/starcross1.jpg)

Upon docking with the strange craft, you must succeed in gaining entry to its mysterious interior. Once within, you will encounter a microcosm of the galaxy, peopled with both harmful and helpful beings. But the great starship serves a far larger purpose than mere cultural exchange. It bears a challenge that was issued eons ago, from light-years away- and only you can meet it.

## How to play

## License and Source code

The source code for starcross can be found [here](https://github.com/historicalsource/starcross).  It is not considered to be under an open license.

As far as I know, Activision have still not declared the games abandonware. 

But I do not believe that it is in the spirit of copyright law that works of art drift into oblivion by unavailability. 
 
The day the games are republished in their old glory, I will gladly remove the files from this repository. Until then, I hope they will be allowed to remain here so you can have fun playing them in a novel way.

## Trivia 

- The original proposal for STARCROSS, "The Ship From The Stars", is located in this directory. It is written by Dave Lebling and dated to November 1981.
- The source code is derived from ZORK/DUNGEON and therefore has a DUNGEON.ZIL in it, likely to allow easy access to already-established room traversal routines. Earlier versions of the code call it "ZORK SF" game before the final name is chosen.
- STARCROSS has support for Grues (the darkness-loving dangerous monsters first seen in ZORK/DUNGEON)
